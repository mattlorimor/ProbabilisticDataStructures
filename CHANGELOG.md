# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - Unreleased

### Added

- A package icon. NuGet renders an embedded icon on the package listing and in Visual
  Studio's package manager; without one the package showed a grey placeholder. The
  design is a bit array with some bits set, which is what a Bloom filter is.

  Shipped as a patch release because 2.0.0 is already published and an icon only
  appears on versions packed after it was added — it is not applied retroactively.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-08

This release modernizes the entire build. The library had not been touched since June
2018 and could no longer be built or tested with current .NET tooling.

### Changed — package identity

- **The package ID is now `MattLorimor.ProbabilisticDataStructures`.**

  Releases from this repository previously had no package of their own. The unprefixed
  `ProbabilisticDataStructures` ID on nuget.org was registered in 2018 by an account
  unaffiliated with this project, which published this project's source; that package is
  not maintained here and will not receive these releases.

  Rather than contest the name, this project ships under an owner-identifying prefix.
  The prefix also makes `MattLorimor.*` eligible for
  [ID prefix reservation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/id-prefix-reservation),
  which prevents anyone else from publishing under it.

  **Only the package ID changed.** The assembly and namespace remain
  `ProbabilisticDataStructures`, so `using ProbabilisticDataStructures;` and every type
  name are unaffected. Updating means changing the `PackageReference` include, nothing
  more.

### Removed

- **Dropped `net45` and `netstandard2.0`. The library now targets `net10.0` only.**

  This is a hard break, and it is deliberate. If you consume this library from .NET
  Framework, from Unity, from Xamarin/Mono, or from any .NET Core or .NET 5–9
  application — including .NET 8, which remains in support until November 2026 —
  **2.0.0 will not install**. The older, unaffiliated 1.0.1 package targets `net45` and
  `netstandard2.0` and remains on nuget.org, but it is not published by this project and
  nothing here governs it.

  Note that this costs no operating-system coverage. `netstandard2.0` is an API
  specification, not a runtime, and `net10.0` runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS across
  x64 and arm64. What narrows is the range of .NET *versions* that can consume the
  package, not the platforms it runs on.

  The rationale is honest about what it is not: the code in this release would still
  compile against `netstandard2.0` unchanged, so multi-targeting was not blocked by
  anything technical. It was declined because a second target cannot be verified.
  `netstandard2.0` is not executable, so proving that binary works would require an
  additional test target on a runtime that consumes it, and without one the package
  would ship a second assembly that nothing ever runs. One target that is fully
  exercised on three operating systems was judged better than two where only one is
  tested. `net45` is a simpler case: it reached end of support in January 2016.

  If you need continued .NET Framework, Unity, or .NET 8 support, please open an issue.
  Restoring a `netstandard2.0` target is a decision that can be revisited if there is
  real demand; the work is small, and the reason it was skipped is verification cost
  rather than incompatibility.

- Deleted Visual Studio–era build artifacts that no longer serve any purpose:
  `Default.testsettings`, `ProbabilisticDataStructures.vsmdi`, and
  `TestProbabilisticDataStructures/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`.

### Changed

- `Defaults.GetDefaultHashAlgorithm()` now calls `MD5.Create()` instead of
  `HashAlgorithm.Create("MD5")`, which is obsolete as of .NET 7 (`SYSLIB0045`) and throws
  under trimming.

  **Hash output is unchanged.** The hash kernel remains byte-for-byte compatible with
  the [Go BoomFilters](https://github.com/tylertreat/BoomFilters) project, and filters
  persisted by 1.x remain readable. This is verified by the existing hash-kernel tests,
  which assert hardcoded digest values captured from the Go implementation.

- Migrated the test project from MSTest v1 to MSTest 4. The old test project was a
  legacy-format `.csproj` bound to Visual Studio's test targets, which meant the suite
  could only be run on Windows from inside Visual Studio. **Tests now run cross-platform
  via `dotnet test`.**

- Test methods now execute in parallel, cutting suite runtime from ~13s to ~5s.

- Replaced the hand-maintained `<Compile Include>` list in the test project with SDK
  globbing, so new test files no longer need to be registered by hand.

### Fixed

- The package version is now declared in the repository (`Directory.Build.props`) rather
  than injected by CI from a build counter. Version numbering restarts from a known
  point: the published 1.0.1 package was built on 2018-06-05 from what was tagged
  `v1.0.9`, so the NuGet version line and the Git tag line had not agreed since 2018.

### Added

- Full package metadata: authors, copyright, description, tags, the Apache-2.0 license
  expression, project and repository URLs, and the README as the package readme. The
  unaffiliated 1.0.1 package had shipped with the SDK's placeholder description,
  `"Package Description"`, and no author or license information.

- Generated XML documentation, packed so consumers get IntelliSense against the library
  rather than bare signatures.

- Source Link with symbols published as a `.snupkg`, so consumers can step into this
  code from their own debugger.

- A tag-driven release pipeline that publishes to NuGet via
  [trusted publishing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/trusted-publishing),
  exchanging a short-lived OIDC token for a temporary API key rather than storing a
  long-lived publishing secret. It refuses to publish when the tag disagrees with the
  declared version.

## [1.0.9] - 2018-06-05

- Improved performance by improving the handling of hashes ([#17](https://github.com/mattlorimor/ProbabilisticDataStructures/pull/17)).

## [1.0.8] - 2018-05-13

- Added `BloomFilter64` to support large Bloom filters ([#16](https://github.com/mattlorimor/ProbabilisticDataStructures/pull/16)).

## [1.0.7] - 2018-04-27

- Build for .NET Standard 2.0 in addition to .NET Framework 4.5 ([#14](https://github.com/mattlorimor/ProbabilisticDataStructures/pull/14)).

## [1.0.0] - 2015-12-31

- Initial release: a C# port of [Tyler Treat's](https://github.com/tylertreat)
  [BoomFilters](https://github.com/tylertreat/BoomFilters) Go project.
